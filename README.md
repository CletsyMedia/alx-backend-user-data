# Personal Data

PII stands for Personally Identifiable Information. It refers to any data that could potentially identify a specific individual. This includes:

1. **Direct Identifiers**: Information that directly identifies an individual, such as their name, social security number, email address, phone number, or driver's license number.

2. **Indirect Identifiers**: Information that, when combined with other data, could identify an individual, such as their date of birth, place of birth, race, ethnicity, gender, or biometric data.

3. **Sensitive Personal Information**: Certain types of PII are considered particularly sensitive, such as financial information, medical information, and information related to an individual's sexual orientation, religious beliefs, or political affiliations.

Protecting PII is crucial for privacy and security reasons, as unauthorized access to this information could lead to identity theft, fraud, or other forms of harm. In various jurisdictions, there are regulations and laws governing the collection, storage, and use of PII to ensure individuals' privacy rights are respected.
